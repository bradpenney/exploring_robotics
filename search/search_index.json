So what is electricity?</p> <p>Electricity is the movement of electrons between atoms, especially in materials where those electrons are free to move (like metals). These free electrons form a current, which powers our devices \u2014 and our robots!</p> Go Deeper <p>Learn more about electric current at the Wikipedia article on Electric Current.</p> <p>Electricity flows well in some materials because electrons can jump freely from one atom to another, making them good conductors.  Examples include metals like copper and aluminum.</p> <p>In other materials - insulators - electricity does not flow well because electrons cannot jump as freely. Materials like rubber, glass, ceramics, plastics, and wood are good insulators.</p> Danger: There is no such thing as a complete insulator! <p>Given enough voltage, even insulators can break down and allow current to flow. This is how lightning strikes, even though air is normally an insulator.  All materials can conduct electricity under the right conditions.</p>"},{"location":"electricity/electricity_basics/#shared-terminology","title":"Shared Terminology","text":"<p>To ensure a shared understanding of electricity, let's define some key terms:</p> <ul> <li>Current: measured in amperes (A), is the flow of electric charge carried by electrons.</li> <li>Voltage: measured in volts (V), is the pressure that drives the current.</li> <li>Resistance:  measured in ohms (\u03a9), is the opposition to flowing of current.</li> </ul> <p>A more familiar way to think about these terms is like water flowing through a garden hose:</p> <ul> <li>Current is the flow rate of water through the garden hose - how much water is coming out?</li> <li>Voltage is the pressure pushing the water through the hose - how much does the water spray out of the end of the garden hose?</li> <li>Resistance is the width of the hose. A wider hose can move a lot more water than a narrow hose.</li> </ul> <p>Clearly these concepts are related. If you increase the voltage (pressure), more current (water) will flow through. If you increase the resistance (narrow the hose), less current will flow for the same voltage.</p>"}]}
