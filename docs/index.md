# Welcome to Exploring Robotics

A subsection of [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io), this site is a hands-on journey into the world of robotics 🧰🤖

I'm diving into robotics as a new hobby that brings together two things I love: programming and building things with my hands. Whether it’s wiring up sensors, programming microcontrollers, or designing chassis and control systems, I’ll be sharing what I learn along the way.

Whether you're curious about getting started or already knee-deep in servos and solder, I hope you'll find something helpful (or at least fun) here! 😄

## Topics I'll be Exploring ⚙️

- Intro to microcontrollers and electronics 🔌
- Basic circuits and sensors 📏
- Actuators, motors, and movement ⚙️
- Embedded programming and firmware 💻
- Robotics project builds and tutorials 🤖

Stay tuned for updates as the robots come to life—thanks for stopping by! 👋
