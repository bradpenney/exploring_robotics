Before beginning to learn about robotics, its essential to know a little bit more about
electricity other than it comes from a wall socket. So what is electricity?

> Electricity is the movement of electrons between atoms, especially in materials where those
> electrons are free to move (like metals). These free electrons form a current, which powers

    Learn more about electric current at the [Wikipedia article on Electric Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current).

Electricity flows well in some materials because electrons can jump freely from one atom to
another, making them good **conductors**.  Examples include metals like copper and aluminum.

In other materials - **insulators** - electricity does not flow well because electrons cannot
jump as freely. Materials like rubber, glass, ceramics, plastics, and wood are good insulators.

    Given enough voltage, even insulators can break down and allow current to flow. This is how
    lightning strikes, even though air is _normally_ an insulator.  All materials can conduct
    electricity under the right conditions.

## Shared Terminology

To ensure a shared understanding of electricity, let's define some key terms:

- **Current**: measured in amperes (A), is the _flow_ of electric charge carried by electrons.
- **Voltage**: measured in volts (V), is the _pressure_ that drives the current.
- **Resistance**:  measured in ohms (Ω), is the opposition to flowing of current.

A more familiar way to think about these terms is like water flowing through a garden hose:

- **Current** is the flow rate of water through the garden hose - how much water is coming out?
- **Voltage** is the pressure pushing the water through the hose - how much does the water spray
out of the end of the garden hose?
- **Resistance** is the width of the hose. A wider hose can move a lot more water than a narrow hose.

Clearly these concepts are related. If you increase the voltage (pressure), more current (water)
will flow through. If you increase the resistance (narrow the hose), less current will flow for
the same voltage.
